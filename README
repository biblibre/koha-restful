Koha REST server
================

This API is deprecated. It is no longer maintained by BibLibre. However, due to its license, it can be forked and modified. If you want to interconnect Koha with other applications, please go to the official Rest API whose documentation is available here : 
https://api.koha-community.org/

Installation notes:
-------------------

Clone the repository:

    git clone git://git.biblibre.com/koha-restful.git $KOHA_REST

Create symlinks into the Koha source directory ($KOHA_SRC):

    ln -s $KOHA_REST/Koha/REST $KOHA_SRC/Koha/
    ln -s $KOHA_REST/opac/rest.pl $KOHA_SRC/opac/
    # This one is optional. It contains unit tests.
    ln -s $KOHA_REST/t/rest $KOHA_SRC/t/

Important note: $KOHA_REST must be absolute path when creating symlinks.

Copy the config directory into the Koha configuration directory ($KOHA_ETC).
It's the one that contains koha-conf.xml after installation (It's usually at
$KOHA_ETC/koha-conf.xml)

    cp -r $KOHA_REST/etc/rest $KOHA_ETC

Install the following package:
    libcgi-application-dispatch-perl

Version information:
--------------------

koha-restful has been tested with Koha 3.8, 3.10 and 3.14.

However Koha 3.8 needs additional patches for koha-restful to fully function:
http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=7065
http://bugs.koha-community.org/bugzilla3/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=10185

Unit tests:
-----------

To launch unit tests, execute the following command (from the root directory of
koha-restful):
  prove t/rest
  prove t/rest/db_dependant

For db_dependant unit tests you will need to give all privileges to the mysql
user used by Koha on database koha_restful_test.
This database will be removed and then recreated each time you launch the tests.
